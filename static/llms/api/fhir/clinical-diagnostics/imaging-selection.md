# ImagingSelection

<span className="fhir-maturity" data-level="1">Trial Use 1</span>
<span className="fhir-category">Clinical — Diagnostics</span>

A selection of DICOM SOP instances and/or frames within a single Study and Series. This might include additional specifics such as an image region, an Observation UID or a Segmentation Number, allowing linkage to an Observation Resource or transferring this information along with the ImagingStudy Resource.

## Endpoints

<ApiBase surface="fhir" path="/ImagingSelection" inline={false} />

| Interaction | Method | Path |
