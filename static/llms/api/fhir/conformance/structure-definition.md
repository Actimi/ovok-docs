# StructureDefinition

<span className="fhir-maturity" data-level="5">Normative</span>
<span className="fhir-category">Conformance</span>

A definition of a FHIR structure. This resource is used to describe the underlying resources, data types defined in FHIR, and also for describing extensions and constraints on resources and data types.

## Endpoints

<ApiBase surface="fhir" path="/StructureDefinition" inline={false} />

| Interaction | Method | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read         | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition/[id]` |
| Vread        | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition/[id]/_history/[vid]` |
| Update       | `PUT`    | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition/[id]` |
| Patch        | `PATCH`  | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition/[id]` |
| Delete       | `DELETE` | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition/[id]` |
| Create       | `POST`   | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition` |
| Search       | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition?...` |
| History      | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition/[id]/_history` |
| Type-history | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/StructureDefinition/_history` |

All calls expect FHIR-flavoured JSON
(`Content-Type: application/fhir+json`) and accept the standard
`Accept: application/fhir+json` header.
