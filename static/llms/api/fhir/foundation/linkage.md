<span className="fhir-maturity" data-level="0">Draft</span>
<span className="fhir-category">Foundation</span>

Identifies two or more records (resource instances) that refer to the same real-world "occurrence".

## Endpoints

<ApiBase surface="fhir" path="/Linkage" inline={false} />

| Interaction | Method | Path |

| Read         | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Linkage/[id]` |
| Vread        | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Linkage/[id]/_history/[vid]` |
| Update       | `PUT`    | `/fhir/R5/Linkage/[id]` |
| Patch        | `PATCH`  | `/fhir/R5/Linkage/[id]` |
| Delete       | `DELETE` | `/fhir/R5/Linkage/[id]` |
| Create       | `POST`   | `/fhir/R5/Linkage` |

| History      | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Linkage/[id]/_history` |

All calls expect FHIR-flavoured JSON
