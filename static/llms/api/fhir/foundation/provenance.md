# Provenance

<span className="fhir-maturity" data-level="4">Trial Use 4</span>
<span className="fhir-category">Foundation</span>

Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.

## Endpoints

<ApiBase surface="fhir" path="/Provenance" inline={false} />

| Interaction | Method | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read         | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Provenance/[id]` |
| Vread        | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Provenance/[id]/_history/[vid]` |
| Update       | `PUT`    | `/fhir/R5/Provenance/[id]` |
| Patch        | `PATCH`  | `/fhir/R5/Provenance/[id]` |
| Delete       | `DELETE` | `/fhir/R5/Provenance/[id]` |
| Create       | `POST`   | `/fhir/R5/Provenance` |
| Search       | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Provenance?...` |
| History      | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Provenance/[id]/_history` |
| Type-history | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Provenance/_history` |

All calls expect FHIR-flavoured JSON
(`Content-Type: application/fhir+json`) and accept the standard
`Accept: application/fhir+json` header.

| `agent-role` | `token` | What the agents role was |
| `agent-type` | `token` | How the agent participated |
| `based-on` | `reference` | Reference to the service request. |
| `encounter` | `reference` | Encounter related to the activity recorded in the AuditEvent |
| `entity` | `reference` | Identity of entity |
| `location` | `reference` | Where the activity occurred, if relevant |
| `patient` | `reference` | The entity that caused the expenses |
| `recorded` | `date` | When the activity was recorded / updated |
| `signature-type` | `token` | Indication of the reason the entity signed the object(s) |
| `target` | `reference` | Target Reference(s) (usually version specific) |
| `when` | `date` | When the activity occurred |
