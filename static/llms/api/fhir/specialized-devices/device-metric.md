# DeviceMetric

<span className="fhir-maturity" data-level="1">Trial Use 1</span>
<span className="fhir-category">Specialized — Devices</span>

Describes a measurement, calculation or setting capability of a device.  The DeviceMetric resource is derived from the ISO/IEEE 11073-10201 Domain Information Model standard, but is more widely applicable. 

## Endpoints

<ApiBase surface="fhir" path="/DeviceMetric" inline={false} />

| Interaction | Method | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read         | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/DeviceMetric/[id]` |
| Vread        | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/DeviceMetric/[id]/_history/[vid]` |
| Update       | `PUT`    | `/fhir/R5/DeviceMetric/[id]` |
| Patch        | `PATCH`  | `/fhir/R5/DeviceMetric/[id]` |
