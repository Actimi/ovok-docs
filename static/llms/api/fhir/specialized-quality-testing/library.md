The Library resource is a general-purpose container for knowledge asset definitions. It can be used to describe and expose existing knowledge assets such as logic libraries and information model descriptions, as well as to describe a collection of knowledge assets.

## Endpoints

<ApiBase surface="fhir" path="/Library" inline={false} />

| Interaction | Method | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read         | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Library/[id]` |
| Vread        | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Library/[id]/_history/[vid]` |
| Update       | `PUT`    | `/fhir/R5/Library/[id]` |
| Patch        | `PATCH`  | `/fhir/R5/Library/[id]` |
| Delete       | `DELETE` | `/fhir/R5/Library/[id]` |
| Create       | `POST`   | `/fhir/R5/Library` |
| Search       | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Library?...` |
| History      | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Library/[id]/_history` |
| Type-history | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Library/_history` |

All calls expect FHIR-flavoured JSON
(`Content-Type: application/fhir+json`) and accept the standard
`Accept: application/fhir+json` header.
