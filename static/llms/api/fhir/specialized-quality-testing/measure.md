The Measure resource provides the definition of a quality measure.

## Endpoints

<ApiBase surface="fhir" path="/Measure" inline={false} />

| Interaction | Method | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read         | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Measure/[id]` |
| Vread        | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Measure/[id]/_history/[vid]` |
| Update       | `PUT`    | `/fhir/R5/Measure/[id]` |

| Create       | `POST`   | `/fhir/R5/Measure` |
| Search       | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Measure?...` |
| History      | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Measure/[id]/_history` |
| Type-history | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/Measure/_history` |

All calls expect FHIR-flavoured JSON
(`Content-Type: application/fhir+json`) and accept the standard
`Accept: application/fhir+json` header.
