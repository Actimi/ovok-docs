# ValueSet

<span className="fhir-maturity" data-level="5">Normative</span>
<span className="fhir-category">Terminology</span>

A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded elements](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/terminologies.html).

## Endpoints

<ApiBase surface="fhir" path="/ValueSet" inline={false} />

| Interaction | Method | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read         | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet/[id]` |
| Vread        | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet/[id]/_history/[vid]` |
| Update       | `PUT`    | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet/[id]` |
| Patch        | `PATCH`  | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet/[id]` |
| Delete       | `DELETE` | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet/[id]` |
| Create       | `POST`   | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet` |
| Search       | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet?...` |
| History      | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet/[id]/_history` |
| Type-history | `GET`    | `/fhir/R5/ValueSet/_history` |

All calls expect FHIR-flavoured JSON
(`Content-Type: application/fhir+json`) and accept the standard
`Accept: application/fhir+json` header.

## Resource-specific search parameters

In addition to the
[universal FHIR search parameters](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/search.html#all),
`ValueSet` supports the parameters below.

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| `context` | `token` | A use context assigned to the activity definition |
| `context-quantity` | `quantity` | A quantity- or range-valued use context assigned to the activity definition |
| `context-type` | `token` | A type of use context assigned to the activity definition |
| `context-type-quantity` | `composite` | A use context type and quantity- or range-based value assigned to the activity definition |
| `context-type-value` | `composite` | A use context type and value assigned to the activity definition |
| `date` | `date` | The activity definition publication date |
| `derived-from` | `reference` | What resource is being referenced |
| `description` | `string` | The description of the activity definition |
| `effective` | `date` | The time during which the activity definition is intended to be in use |
