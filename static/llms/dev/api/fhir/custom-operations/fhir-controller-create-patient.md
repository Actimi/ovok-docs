### `200` → `PatientResponseDto` (`application/json`)

A FHIR Patient resource as stored in the FHIR API. When created with `?withSignals=true` the resource is re-read after Signals provisioning so any identifiers stamped by the link step are reflected.

- `resourceType`: `string` **(required)**
- `id`: `string` **(required)**

_Additional properties allowed._

**Example**

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "87ea5dfc-8b8e-384d-8489-79496e706390",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "1",
    "lastUpdated": {}
  },
  "name": [
    {
      "given": [
        "Ada"
      ],
      "family": "Lovelace"
    }
  ],
  "birthDate": {},
  "gender": "female"

```
