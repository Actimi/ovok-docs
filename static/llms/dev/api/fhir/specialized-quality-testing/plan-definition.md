# PlanDefinition

<span className="fhir-maturity" data-level="4">Trial Use 4</span>
<span className="fhir-category">Specialized — Quality & Testing</span>

This resource allows for the definition of various types of plans as a sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. The resource is general enough to support the description of a broad range of clinical and non-clinical artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, order sets, protocols, and drug quality specifications.
